Boilerexams Application Project

This project is a React based statistics dashborad that analyses local user submission data. It displays metrics like accuracy, total attempts, average number of attempts etc.

The data displayed by the dashboard:
  1. Total questions and attempts
  2. Accuracy and first-try accuracy metrics
  3. Average attempts per question
  4. Attempts distribution per question
  5. Answer choice distribution (A–E) 

AI Use: I did use AI for this project but only while working with the css file.

How to run the code:
  1. Open the project folder in VS Code
  2. Install the Live Server extension
  3. Right-click index.html and click open with Live Server
